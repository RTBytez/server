RTBytez offers developers using JetBrains IDE's an alternative way of writing code: In real time. No more merge conflicts or lost code due to forgetting to commit. Let the server take care of all of that for you. RTBytez intergrates directly into a git repository to avoid headaches when tracking changes.
